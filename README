Tiny PIC Boot Loader Command Line Tool
======================================

Based (very heavily) on the code by ferezvi (ferezvi@gmail.com) from
http://tinybldlin.sf.net, I've basically just cut and pasted then
removed all the GUI code that was scatter throughout. I've also fixed
a bug that stopped it working with 16Fxx chips.

This works with the Tiny PIC Bootloader from
http://www.etc.ugal.ro/cchiculita/software/picbootloader.htm It
provides the PC part and it works from the command line in Linux
(probably Windows and OSX too, but I haven't tested it). It may or may
not work for you, I just I needed something I could stick in my
Makefile.
